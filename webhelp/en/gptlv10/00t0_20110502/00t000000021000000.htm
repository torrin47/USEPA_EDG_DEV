The standard provides a common set of terminology for concepts related to the metadata. U.S. government agencies that receive federal funds to create metadata had to follow this standard in the past. Now there is a move for government agencies to use the North American Profile for their metadata instead. The FGDC standard implementation is freely <a target="_blank" class="xref" href="http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/" rel="http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/">available online</a>, and contains 334 elements. Files in the Geoportal Server that define support for FGDC can be found in the <i>\\geoportal\WEB-INF\classes\gpt\metadata\fgdc</i> folder.</li>

ISO 19115 is used for describing geographic datasets.  ISO 19119 is used to describe web services.  To distinguish ISO 19119 Services metadata, check for the presence of &lt;SV_ServiceIdentification&gt; tags, which will only be present in the ISO 19119 Services metadata. The ISO standards must be purchased, and are available at <a target="_blank" class="xref" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/store.htm" rel="http://www.iso.org/iso/store.htm">http://www.iso.org/iso/store.htm</a>.

Recently, this has changed, as it has become important for an internationally recognized standard to be used to facilitate data sharing across borders, specifically on the North American continent. The North American Profile is based on the ISO 19115 (dataset) and ISO 19119 (services) metadata profile, but implements additional mandatory values that are not mandatory as per the ISO standards alone. For more information on the North American Profile, see the Federal Geographic Data Committee's <a target="_blank" class="xref" href="http://www.fgdc.gov/nap/metadata" rel="http://www.fgdc.gov/nap/metadata">NAP website</a>.

INSPIRE metadata is based on the ISO 19115 (dataset) and ISO 19119 (services) standard. INSPIRE also implements extended elements and different mandatory elements than the standard ISO.
