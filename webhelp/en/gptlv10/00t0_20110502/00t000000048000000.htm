The types of relationship the resource has may vary depending
on the metadata profile of that resource and specific customizations applied to the
geoportal. For ISO-based metadata, the relationships are defined using the <i>usedBy</i> and <i>operatesOn</i> service metadata elements.  You will see these elements when you expand the <span class="uicontrol">Resource</span> node on the <span class="uicontrol">Relationships</span> page for that resource.</p><p id="GUID-F0CEB9E2-A448-4880-9A29-47B829B106C3">For example, if you expand the <span class="uicontrol">Resource</span> node and see <span class="uicontrol">Used By</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Operates On</span> nodes beneath it, you can click on these sub-nodes to see datasets that are used by the selected resource if it is a service, or see other services that are operating on the selected resource

It is possible to create relationships between different resources by connecting them through relationship elements  in the resources' metadata.  For details about how to create these resource
relationships, see <a class="xref" rel="00t0/00t000000046000000.htm" href="00t0/00t000000046000000.htm">Create Relationships between Resources</a>.</p></div>
