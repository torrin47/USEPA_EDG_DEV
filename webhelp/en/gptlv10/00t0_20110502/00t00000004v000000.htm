This service endpoint has the ability to generate GeoRSS, KML, ATOM, JSON, HTML and HTML fragment responses. Requests are parsed by a RestQueryParser component and executed through the SearchEngine component. Any client that can understand RSS, GeoRSS, KML, ATOM, JSON or HTML protocol can utilize this endpoint. Typical clients include: browsers, content management systems, ArcGIS Explorer, and Google Earth.

Any client that understands the CSW 2.0.2 Discovery protocol can query the catalog through this end point. The Geoportal CSW Client components that plug into ArcGIS Explorer and ArcGIS Desktop can utilize this end point. External mapping applications can be configured to utilize this end point.
