Modifying Help Files in Geoportal V1.0
Johns Sievel, 20110324

All help files are html snippets with cryptic name. This procedure assumes that you want
to modify an existing help file. It is possible to create new files and add them to
the index tree, and even change the tree structure, but that is beyond the scope of
these instructions.

All of the help files are on Base Camp in a file called 00t0.zip. The contents of this
zip file came from gptlv10/webhelp/en/gptlv10/00t0 directory. Any files that are modified
must be put back in this directory.

To find the file name of the file to be modified, click on the topic in the index
of the help system. The file name is the last part of what is displayed in the browser 
location bar. For example, if you click on "What is the Geoportal Server", you will see:
http://dev.innovateteam.com:6112/gptlv10/webhelp/en/gptlv10/00t0/00t000000012000000.htm.
The filename is 00t000000012000000.htm.

Any external files that the snippet references will need to also be stored in the 00t0
directory.

Since the help files were apparently generated by some sort of authoring system, it seems
likely that the names may change in future releases.
